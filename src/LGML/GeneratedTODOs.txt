//////////////////////////////////////
 Auto - Generated TODO list from source code with Scripts/generateTODOList.py
 useless to overwrite !! but useful for rainy sunday code cleaning and improving
 TODOs in source code are not meant to be features but improvement and cleaning of CODE
 a discussion can be added after TODO comment line in source code (but not meant to be long) 
 Of course this list can also be used to remove unnecessary TODOs...

		// TODO check if we can optimize copies
		// handle multiples channels outs

	line : 348

		// should be fixed !!
